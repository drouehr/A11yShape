Concentric with the sphere is a flat annulus extruded to a small thickness (3 units) whose inner circular boundary has radius 26 and outer boundary radius 44; the annulus is centered on the same origin but rotated (tilted) about the X-axis by 20 degrees so its plane is oblique to the sphere\u2019s equatorial plane. The annular disk is centered on and intersects the sphere around the sphere\u2019s midsection: because the annulus inner radius (26) exceeds the sphere radius (20), the ring passes around the sphere with a gap between sphere surface and ring plane except where the tilted geometry causes the ring to intersect or pass close to the sphere on opposite sides. The annulus is symmetric about the origin and about the plane defined by its rotation axis; the overall assembly has bilateral symmetry through the plane containing the ring\u2019s rotation axis and the sphere center. The ring\u2019s thickness is small compared with its radial size, producing a thin torus-like disk whose outer radius (44) is more than twice the sphere radius."}
